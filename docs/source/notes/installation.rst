Installation
============

We have outsourced a lot of functionality of PyTorch Geometric to other packages, which needs to be installed in advance.
These packages come with their own CPU and GPU kernel implementations based on the newly introduced `C++/CUDA extensions <https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp/>`_ in PyTorch 0.4.0.

#. Install the package:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ pip install karateclub
